# My_OldDLcodes 
Some of my implementations of a few interesting deep learning models (using Tensor Flow) including: 

1. [LSTM based Attention for machine translation.](https://github.com/AlirezaRahimpour/My_DLcodes/blob/master/Neural_machine_translation_with_attention.ipynb)
2. [Triplet loss for face recognition.](https://github.com/AlirezaRahimpour/My_DLcodes/blob/master/Triplet%20loss%20for_Face_Recognition.ipynb)
3. [Car detection (YOLO) for autonomous cars.](https://github.com/AlirezaRahimpour/My_DLcodes/blob/master/Car_detection_for_Autonomous_driving.ipynb)
4. [ResNet.](https://github.com/AlirezaRahimpour/My_DLcodes/blob/master/Residual_Networks.ipynb)
5. [Building CNN from scratch without any deep learning package.](https://github.com/AlirezaRahimpour/My_DLcodes/blob/master/CNN_form_scratch.ipynb)
6. [Simple recognition task using CNN in TF with step by step details.](https://github.com/AlirezaRahimpour/My_DLcodes/blob/master/CNN_Sign_recognition.ipynb)
7. RNN from scratch. 

Most of the codes are from my humble beginning and are based on amazing Deep learning specialization ([deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)) programming assignments that I have taken several years ago.
