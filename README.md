# My_DLcodes
My Implementation of some deep learning models (using Tensor Flow and Keras) including: 

1. LSTM based Attention for machine translation. 
2. Triplet loss for face recognition.
3. Car detection (YOLO) for autonomous cars. 
4. ResNet.
5. Building CNN from scratch without any deep learning package.
6. Simple recognition task using CNN in TF with step by step details. 

Most of the codes are based on amazing Deep learning specializatin (deeplearning.ai) programming assignments that I took.
